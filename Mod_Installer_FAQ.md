### **What should I do if the installer isn’t working?**

- Make sure your game and mod directory is correct.
- Make sure you are using the unpacked version of the game
- Make sure the installer and mods are up-to-date.

### **I keep getting a read Error and the game won't launch:**

Hit the "Repair" button to repair your game and try installing mods again.

### **How do I run the program on Linux?**

You will need to install these dependencies:
- A compatible version of glibc and standard Linux libraries (usually already installed).
- Tkinter support: 
  sudo apt-get install python3-tk
- Wine:
  sudo apt-get install wine
- Basic X11 libraries and a windowing system (which are typically part of your desktop environment).

To run the installer:
     Give execute permission to your script:
            chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh
     And to run your script:
            /path/to/yourscript.sh

### **How do I uninstall mods?**

Hit the repair button to uninstall all mods.

### **Where do I put the game and mod folder?**

Anywhere you'd like, just remeber where you saved them for the installer. I would recommend putting everything in the same folder named "SWBF3 Wii".

### **What if I'm using the portable version of Dolphin?**

For AppData hit "Custom Path" and select your *Dolphin-x64/Sys/Load* directory.

### **I get the error "The directory does not contain . . ."?**

It means you have not downloaded and extracted either the unpacked version of the game or the mods folder. You need to download both of these and extract them then select the extracted folders.

### **"No mod_versions.json is found"?**

It means you either selected the wrong folder or you didn't download the Mods.zip and exctracted it.

### **"compile_templates_and_res.bat still not found after copying"?**

It means you have not downloaded and extracted either the unpacked version of the game or the mods folder. You need to download both of these and extract them then select the extracted folders.

### **I keep getting "Failed to copy . . ." errors?**

- Hit check for updates
- If updating doesn't work, It means you have not downloaded and extracted either the unpacked version of the game or the mods folder. You need to download both of these and extract them then select the extracted folders.

### **What should I do if my modded game is still not working?**

- Re-extract all mod files.
- Make sure your folder paths are correct.
- Redownload/ update the installer if necessary, as updates may have fixed certain issues.
- Run the "Repair" option in the installer
- Ask in the Mod Installer Discord
### **How do I update/ get the new mods and installer?**

Hit check for updates.

### **Do I need to redownload Mods.zip every time there's an update or new mod?**

No, just hit check for updates and the installer will automaticlly download and manage everything.

### **Why can't I select all mods and install? "ERROR File: . . . is present in Mods . . .**

Some mods are not compatible with each other and will overwrite/ break the game when installed together. Look at the errors to see which mods are not compatible and choose which ones you want installed.

### **The mod isn't working after I installed it**

If the installer gave no errors when installing a mod and the mod is not working in game:

- Go to the mod installer discord form
- Say which mod is not working
- Include a screenshot if applicable
- Give exact details such as, was it installed on a new copy of the game?, which mods are also installed?, did you install mulitple mods with it and which ones?, what version is your installer? etc...
